## Learn about Piiano Vault transformations and how to use them

In this guide, you learn about transformations, a mechanism to reduce data exposure by masking part of a value, for example, by returning a telephone number as `***-****-2795`. You discover how to obtain a list of the transformations available in Vault and a reference list of the built-in transformations.
