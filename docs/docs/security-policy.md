# Security policy

Piiano works hard to ensure the security of its products. The steps Piiano takes to ensure product security include penetration tests, automated scans, and internal and external reviews of the code, design, and architecture. However, vulnerabilities may still be discovered in Vault or one of its dependencies.

If you discover a vulnerability in Vault, please inform us at security@piiano.com.

Piiano fixes vulnerabilities discovered in any dependencies as part of the regular release cycle. All dependencies are updated and checked for vulnerabilities during a release using automated tools. If a critical vulnerability is found, Piiano will issue an urgent update for Vault to fix the vulnerability and inform all users.
