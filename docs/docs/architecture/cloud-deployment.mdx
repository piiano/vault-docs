# Cloud Deployment

Vault can be deployed on a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure. On these platforms, Vault can be deployed as a server or serverless. For example, on Google Cloud Platform Vault can be deployed as a serverless service using Cloud Run. 

Vault is implemented using two services: a Control service for making control changes such as IAM configuration and schema changes, and a Data service for CRUD operations on data. 

The main elements in a Vault deployment are:
* The Vault server. There can be one server running both services, or the services may be deployed separately.
* The backend database. For example, Postgres RDS.
* A load balancer or API gateway to manage access to the Vault services.

This diagram shows an example of the high-level architecture in an AWS deployment.
