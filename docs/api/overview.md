# Introduction

The Piiano Vault REST API enables you to access and manage collections, objects, tokens, users, policies, and other resources within Piiano Vault in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests and standard HTTP response codes.

The API follows RESTful conventions when possible, with most operations performed by `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests. Request and response bodies are [JSON-encoded](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). However, for collection operations, an SQL-like [PVSchema](/guides/manage-collections-and-schemas/reference/pvschema) encoding is available.

This API reference provides details for each operation available in the API.

When you install a local copy of Vault, you can try each operation using **Send API request**.

An OpenAPI specification is available in [YAML](@site/static/assets/openapi.yaml) and [JSON](@site/static/assets/openapi.json) formats and can be used to generate client code for the API.
