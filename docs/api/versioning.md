# Versioning

The Piiano Vault API is versioned, and the version is part of the API base URL. For example, for version `1.0` the URL is prefixed `/api/pvlt/1.0/`.

The introduction of **backward-incompatible** changes to the API will result in the introduction of a new API version. There won't be a new version for new features and additions to the API, such as adding an operation or including a new object in an operation's response.
