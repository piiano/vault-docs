# Individual privacy rights

Managing **Right To Erasure (also known as Right To Be Forgotten or RTBF)** and **Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)** is easy with Vault. When instructed to forget a person, Vault will keep evidence of the deletion and let you configure the properties to delete and retain. Deleted persons will be hidden, and only a legal role will be able to access them.
