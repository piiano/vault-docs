# CLI overview

## Learn about using the Piiano CLI to work with Piiano in the command line.

The Piiano Vault CLI enables you to perform key actions from the command prompt.

By default, the CLI command returns a tabulated text format. For example:

```bash
pvault --addr=http://localhost:8123 status

+------+---------+
| DATA | CONTROL |
+------+---------+
| pass | pass    |
+------+---------+
```

To return the content in JSON format, use `--json` or `-j`. By default, the JSON is returned prettified; use the `--compact` / `-c` flag to get a compact version of the JSON.

### docker exec

Vault containers include the CLI `pvault` that is configured to interact with the Vault server.

If Vault is run with Docker, this command can be used to interact with `pvault`:

```bash
docker exec -it pvault-dev pvault status

+------+---------+
| DATA | CONTROL |
+------+---------+
| pass | pass    |
+------+---------+
```

When working with different editions, change the `pvault-dev` container name in the command above to the edition you are wokring with: `pvault-server`, `pvault-data` or `pvault-control`.

When running Vault with docker-compose, this command is used to interact with `pvault`:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec piiano-vault-server pvault status

+------+---------+
| DATA | CONTROL |
+------+---------+
| pass | pass    |
+------+---------+
```

To interact with the data and control containers, change `piiano-vault-server` to `piiano-vault-data` and `piiano-vault-control` respectively.
